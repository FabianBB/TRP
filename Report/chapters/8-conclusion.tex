\section{Conclusion}

Overall, it seems that an AGV could be a candidate to replace human labor when the conditions are set right. These conditions concluded from this study are that the environment should contain proper, sturdy, non white or -transparent walls \& objects. The AGV must be equipped with a proper localization sensor such as a LIDAR sensor.
The abundance of documentation on AGV configuration makes the setup stage a very straight forward process. Existing ROS packages reduce the requirement for manual implementation. 

An AGV equipped with a LIDAR sensor, which implements an AMCL algorithm and a GMapping algorithm is capable of autonomous navigation in industrial environments. The AGV's ability to communicate with other nodes  of the network such as robotic arms or cameras can greatly improve the efficiency and automation of industrial processes. 

Future work should focus on addressing the limitations of the current system and integrating more advanced technologies to improve the AGV's capabilities.
