% some information here about the project as a whole and the role of the AGV 
% all interacting components or just some general info about the isnect farm and corosect

The scope of our research is within the insect-farm project instantiated by CoRoSect. This is a factory environment that aims to digitalize and integrate robotic solutions to support all insect life cycle phases. The goal is to create a collaborative environment where humans and robots harmoniously share and undertake various cognitively and physically demanding tasks, such as transferring and handling crates (de-stacking and stacking), monitoring environmental conditions larvae separation/detection, insect feeding, and more. 
Our study is about the role of an AGV within this farm. The tasks it can perform and the accuracy it has performing these tasks.
