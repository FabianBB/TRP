# TRP
Given a complete directed graph G = (V, E), the traveling repairman problem consists of
determining a Hamiltonian circuit minimizing the sum of the waiting times of customers located at the nodes of
the graph. In this paper, we propose two new linear integer formulations for TRP and computationally evaluate
the strength of their linear programming relaxations. Computational results show the efficiency of the second
new formulation considering the LP relaxations gaps and CPU times. The larger instance solved to optimality
with the proposed second formulation involves 29 vertices. This compares favorably with a previously published
formulation.
